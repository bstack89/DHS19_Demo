# About Brian's DHS19 Demo Page

This is Brian's great demo page for the DHS2019 Symposium.
I am learning things, like how this is on a separate line in the code but on the same line when displayed.

Putting a blank line between things creates a new paragraph, like the one I have here.

Here's a list of things to consider:
- popcorn
  - buttery
  - salty
  - hot air/oil
- antique vehicles
- golden plains

Thanks Brian for being great and doings this. To go back home [click here](index.html)
